description: Add comprehensive tests for a feature
---

Add comprehensive test coverage:

1. Ask user which feature/component to test
2. Create Jest unit tests in `__tests__/`
3. Create Playwright E2E tests in `e2e/` if applicable
4. Ensure tests cover:
   - Happy path scenarios
   - Error cases
   - Edge cases
   - Integration points
5. Run tests and verify they pass
6. Update test documentation if needed

Aim for 70%+ coverage to meet project threshold.
