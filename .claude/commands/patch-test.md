Test the PatchPath AI patch generation system:

1. Start the dev server if not running
2. Use the demo rack: https://modulargrid.net/e/racks/view/2383104
3. Test the rack analysis endpoint
4. Test patch generation with a creative prompt
5. Verify the response includes connections, patching order, and tips
6. Report any errors or issues found

Goal: Ensure the core AI functionality is working end-to-end.
